## Music Player Application

This is a Next.js application that functions as a music player, inspired by Spotify. It utilizes Chakra UI for building the user interface, Prisma as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool, and PostgreSQL as the database.

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev - run server
pnpm run prisma:generate - generate prisma client
pnpm run prisma:migrate:dev - apply migrations
```
